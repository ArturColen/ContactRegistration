# Contact Registration
This project is designed to facilitate knowledge-sharing among fellow students, focusing on the concepts taught during Web Interface Development classes. It serves as a resource for the development of the final project of the first term.

## üî® Project functionality
The project features a contact registry with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete contact data. This functionality is implemented using pure JavaScript and the JSON Server library, simulating a web server (API).

## üíª Technologies used
* [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/HTML): page structuring, accessibility and semantics
* [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS): page styling, animation and responsiveness
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/): provides ready-to-use HTML and CSS components, facilitating the creation of responsive web interfaces
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript): enables page dynamism and API connection
* [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server/blob/v0/README.md): enables the creation of a RESTful API using a JSON file as a data source

## üìÅ Project access
You can view the hosted page by clicking [here](https://contact-registration.vercel.app/).

**Note**: if you encounter an error reading the contacts on the hosted site, it may be due to the JSON server API not currently running. In such cases, you can [clone this project](https://github.com/ArturColen/ContactRegistration.git) along with the [API hosted on Repl.it](https://replit.com/@ArturColen/ContactRegistrationServer) for testing purposes. Remember to update the `apiUrl` in the `connection.js` file to the cloned API link.
